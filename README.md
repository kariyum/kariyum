### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a computer science student, interested in backend engineering and artificial intelligence like genetic algorithms and neural networks. Also, I was hooked to combinatorial optimization approachs and I became intrigued by the Ant Colony Optimization metaheuristic approach, so I made a simulation on the web, that is, a way to interact with the algorithm.
